During my journey to land my first job as a software developer, I was able to connect with very knowledgeable and well-connected people. One of them was a retired Army officer who became the president of an organization that turned zero code experience individuals into software developers. He referred me to a local prop-tech SaaS startup, Land Intelligence, Inc. I spoke with the VP of the company and landed an interview which was amazing. During the interview, she spoke about the landing page needing work and after our call, we set an interview for Monday. It was Friday afternoon, so I needed to prep for the interview!

I did a ton of research about the company, but I wanted to walk in with more than just knowledge about the company. So, I took it upon myself to create a responsive landing page for the company to display my capabilities. There was one thing that bothered me about their current landing page, and I knew it was a huge pain for their business as well. The startup needed to have pristine web pages, so new users and investors would take their product very seriously and sign up or invest in seed rounds, but their current landing page was not attractive, and we both agreed it wasn't sending the right message to users and investors. That's why I decided to show them I could solve this issue and many more.

The next two days, Saturday, and Sunday, I developed a plan, and landing page then deployed it live to production, so the world could see my accomplishment. I walked into the interview Monday, and they loved my initiative and problem-solving abilities, and I landed my very first job as a software developer!
